We're using built-in middleware express.json() to parse JSON bodies of incoming requests.

Application-level middleware is used to log incoming requests.

Router-level middleware authenticate is used to authenticate authors before creating new blogs.

Configurable middleware authenticate checks the provided credentials and adds the authenticated author to the request object.

Routes are defined within the authorRouter, including registration, fetching all authors, creating new blogs, and retrieving blogs by author's ID.

The authorRouter is mounted at the /authors endpoint in the main Express application.

The server is started on the specified port (or default port 3000).
